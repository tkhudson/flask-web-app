# flask-web-app
This repository contains the source code for a Flask web application. The application is built using the Flask framework, a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.

It includes features such as routing, templating, and request handling, making it ideal for building dynamic web applications and APIs. The repository also includes configuration files, dependencies, and other resources necessary for running the Flask application. The application's codebase is organized into modules, with each module responsible for a specific aspect of the application, such as handling user authentication, serving static assets, or interacting with a database. This repository serves as a starting point for developing and deploying Flask-based web applications.
